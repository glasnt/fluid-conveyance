## Abstract

Initial study found that the same properties that made Arnott's Tim Tams capable of being able to be used as a straw with hot beverages were also found in Girl Scout Tagalongs. Both cookies^[The term 'cookie' is used here, although a Tim Tam would be identified within the Australian English dialect as a 'biscuit'. This study uses 'cookie' as a general term] are able to be used in a "Tim Tam Slam".

## Keywords

Tim Tam Slam, Tim Tams, Tagalongs

## Introduction

The Australian institution of the Tim Tam Slam is a historical artefact of British colonisation, wherein a Tim Tam is used as a straw -- by biting off opposing corners of the cookie -- and used to consume a warm beverage. The hypothesis that this method could be applied to other cookies was initially proved after a survey of a majority of available Girl Scout Cookies, finding that only Tagalongs shared similar characteristics in order to form a pressure seal within the cookie as to serve as a straw.

## Methods

A number of cookies were acquired [Casasi], accompanied by a number of warm beverages, based on the participants preferences.

The survey included:

* Arnott's Tim Tams Original
* Girl Scout Savannah Smiles
* Girl Scout Do-si-dos
* Girl Scout Toffee-tastic
* Girl Scout Samoas
* Girl Scout Tagalongs
* Girl Scout Trefoils

Beverages included:

* Hot black coffee
* Hot chocolate

A primary elimination of the sample cookies was performed, based on the lack of a chocolate seal around the cookie. This reduced the sample size down to: Arnott's Tim Tams Original, and Girl Scout Tagalongs.

Both cookies were pierced at opposing corners. In the case of Tagalongs, this was performed at opposite sides of the circular cookie.

Both samples were then used as a beverage conduit, with careful observation of the structural integrity of the sample so as not to collapse under, and into, the beverage.

## Results

Delicious chocolatey goodness -- with accents of peanut butter.

## Discussion

Some wondered if science had gone too far, even before the study was defined, that surely a cookie could not serve as a conduit for warm liquids. The cultural learnings of cross-American-and-Australian partnerships was able to determine that yes, the physical properties of chocolate coated cookie with a channel conduit were able to be "Slammed".

It was also noted by a study onlooker that the channel of peanut butter in the Tagalong may have assisted in the straw-capacity of the cookie. However, given the cookie is round, it's difficult to ensure this orientation in the Slam.
